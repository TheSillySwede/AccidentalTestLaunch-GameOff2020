# AccidentalTestLaunch-GameOff2020

This is the first time I use GitHub, 5 hours before the end of the Game Off.

We should really have used version control. Learn from our mistakes, PLEASE.

Now, for the project file, you'll see that the game is called "Accidental Test Flight", but the project files are named "ShootForTheMoon". Don't worry about it, I just didn't fix that yet.
